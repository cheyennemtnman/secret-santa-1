* secret-santa

  This script selects secret santas from a list of people. The rules are as follows:
  
  - Your secret santa cannot be you.
  - Your secret santa cannot be someone in your immediate familial unit.
  - Your secret santa cannot be the same person as it was last year.
  - There can be no mutual santas.

  The script takes a list of people with their familial unit specified and an email address. The pairings are generated
  and an email is generated to each person letting them know for who they are a secret santa.
